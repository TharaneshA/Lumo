## 🧪 About This Project

This project was built as a **learning initiative** to dive deep into how modern **voice models like Whisper** work — especially around:

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-text transcription accuracy**
- 🧠 **Context-aware formatting and post-processing**
- ⚙️ **Integrating voice capture into modern frontend frameworks**
- 🔁 **Improving user workflows with AI**

If you're curious about **speech recognition**, **real-time audio processing**, or building a UI around it — this is a great starting point.
